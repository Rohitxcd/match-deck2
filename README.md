*🔮 AI Engine Overview*


The AI middleware powers matchmaking by analyzing:

<ins>>Student profiles </ins>(skills, projects, grades, preferences)

<ins>>Employer requirements</ins> (job roles, skills, culture fit, location)

<ins>>Historical success data</ins>(past hires, interview outcomes)

<ins>Core Functions:</ins>

        >Smart Matchmaking Engine

        >Priority Ranking Lists

        >Personalized  
        Recommendations

*⚙ Matching Algorithm (Simplified)*


1.)<ins>Data Normalization</ins> → Converts student & job info into feature vectors (skills, projects, preferences)

2.)<ins> Similarity Scoring </ins>→ Cosine Similarity / BERT embeddings

3.)<ins>Weighted Match %</ins>

Match% = (0.5 × Skills + 0.3 × Projects + 0.2 × Preferences) × 100

Example: Skills=0.8, Projects=0.6, Pref=0.9 → 77% Match

4.)<ins>Priority List</ins> → Both students & employers see ranked matches

5.)<ins>Continuous Learning</ins>→ Feedback loop improves recommendations (like Netflix 🎬)

*🔑 Extra AI Features*

<ins>Natural Language Search</ins>→ e.g. “Find me a remote AI internship in Bangalore”

<ins>Explainability</ins> → AI explains matches ("Matched because you know Python + ML, but missing SQL")

<ins>Chatbot Support</ins> → Resume help, interview prep, recruiter queries
